This is a small & beginning-stage voice-controlled bot. 

The bot can only perform basic function such as telling the Time, Open Whastapp on browser, Open Browser, Shutdown itself. 
You can add other functions according to what you want. 

The authentication phrase lies within the code however I am adding it here for ease. 
AUTH PHRASE = "hello Friday"

😁Also keep in mind whether it is a person or a bot always respect and talk politely as this bot will not understand commands if you are not respectful and polite towards it😁
